## Navigating the UI

- **Homepage** Upon logging in, you will be directed to your properties page, which will allow you to view, edit, or create analysis for a new property.
- **Add New Property** Clicking the Add New Property button will redirect to a form page, prompting you to fill in some information about your property. Our software will then use that data to calculate different factors of this property using industry formulas.

- **Updating Property** There are two ways that you can edit information about a property. You can either click the edit button in the property page or click the update button in the analysis page.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40508134/103447061-56134780-4c54-11eb-96c9-6c2197ae615f.gif"></td>

       </tr> 
    </table>
      
 - **Viewing existing properties** All your existing properties will populate in your properties page. We incorporated a search bar for you to search properties based on address. To view data about an existing property, just click the view button, which will direct you to the analysis page of that property.
