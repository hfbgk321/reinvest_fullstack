Problems we Faced: handling https request while using authorization, using multer and blobs to process and send in receive images to server

How we solved the problems: We solved the routing problems by first debugging and testing the routes on Postma, once confirmed we went and debugged the front end to also work


Things we learned: MERN, image processing, cookies, autho, backend, encrypt and decrypt, responsive design
