Have you wondered if a house is a good buy for your real estate portfolio? Our free software will give any user important details to help make the decision a lot easier for you. Important attributes that are considered are Cash on Cash return, ROI, Net Operating Income, Fixed Monthly Morgage, Monthly Cash Flow, and much more valuable details to come to a decision. The software also allows you to save your previous houses, allowing you to come back and check them whenever you want.
