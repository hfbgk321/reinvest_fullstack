## Navigating the UI

- **Homepage** Upon logging in, you will be directed to your properties page, which will allow you to view, edit, or create analysis for a new property.
- **Add New Property** Clicking the Add New Property button will redirect to a form page, prompting you to fill in some information about your property. Our software will then use that data to calculate different factors of this property using industry formulas.

## Getting Started

How to Run this on your local server: clone the project, and npm install the dependencies, npm run

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You need node and vscode to install dependencies
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
git clone , open in ide, There's a backend file, which you can run on port 4000 by npm install and to start use npm run dev.

There's also a front end file that you can run on port 3000 by npm install and to start use npm start.

Look at .env.example for connecting to MongoDB and Token Secret
```



End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Acknowledgments

Problems we Faced: handling https request while using authorization, using multer and blobs to process and send in receive images to server

How we solved the problems: We solved the routing problems by first debugging and testing the routes on Postma, once confirmed we went and debugged the front end to also work


Things we learned: MERN, image processing, cookies, autho, backend, encrypt and decrypt, responsive design
